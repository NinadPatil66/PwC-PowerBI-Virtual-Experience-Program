# Introduction:
The virtual experience program provided a risk-free way to experience work on the job at PwC. I worked through different real-life but fictitious business use cases where PowerBI was used to design convincing visualizations to identify patterns, risks and opportunities in data, and turn them into actionable insights. 

## PowerBI-Dashboard-1: Call Centre Trends
Respond to the client's request by providing a well-designed Power BI dashboard reflecting the requested KPIs. The client is a giant telecom company. Their call centre manager contacted you to provide some level of insight and transparency into the call centre data, for example, the total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. This will help her in getting an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. These insights will then be further discussed with the management.

### Possible KPIs:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- The Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

The above dashboard provides trends and insights into various metrics and KPIs related to the Call Centre data. It also provides the option of applying various filters such as Satisfaction Rating, Agent Name, Week, Topic etc. <br> Major Highlights from the Dashboard: 
- 72% of the cases which were logged were resolved.
- 81% of the calls were answered by the agents.
- The average satisfaction rating was 3.4.
- There were equal # of cases for each topic.
  
## PowerBI Dashboard-2: Telecom Customer Retention Strategy
The data provided has around 7043 customer records out of which 1869 have left within the last month. 
- One trend that seems a bit peculiar is that customers are opting out of paperless billings (A whooping 1400 customers). A survey asking the customers as to why they are opting for "Paper Billings", can help to improve/earn new customers.
- Looking at the customer demographics data, customers who do not have any dependents and those who are unmarried are most likely to leave. Around 1200 unmarried customers and 1500 customers without dependents have left. Listening to their demands/pain points can help to lower the churn rate.
- Priorities in having a 1 or 2-year contract with the customers, as customers with contracts less than these will tend to opt out of your telecom services (Around 1655 customers had signed month-to-month contracts).
- Fibre-optic customers also seem to be unhappy with the service, almost 1300 customers have left within the last month. An in-depth study as to why the service is not performing up to the mark is the need of the hour.
- One more area to focus your attention towards is your digital technology stack. The electronic check method seems to have been frequently failing, which may have frustrated the 1K users who used the Electronic check method. Also, try to figure out if there are any significant issues with other payment issues. Fixing them can help to a great extent.
- Finally, explaining the benefits of having device protection will help in retaining a significant chunk of the customers.
Working on the above points will help in retaining customers and lowering your churn rate for the next month.
