# Learnings Acquired:
Framing the Business Scenario - Business Metrics and Key Performance Indicators, CEO Dashboards, Choosing the right visuals, Creating Effective Visualizations

# Introduction:
The virtual experience program provided a risk-free way to experience work on the job at PwC. I worked through different real-life but fictitious business use cases where PowerBI was used to design convincing visualizations to identify patterns, risks and opportunities in data, and turn them into actionable insights. 

## Details:
•	Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.<br>
•	Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.<br>
•	Strong communication skills reflected in concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.<br>
•	Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

## PowerBI-Dashboard-1: Call Centre Trends
Respond to the client's request by providing a well-designed Power BI dashboard reflecting the requested KPIs. The client is PhoneNow, a telecom giant. Their call centre manager contacted you to provide some level of insight and transparency into the call centre data, for example, the total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. This will help her in getting an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. These insights will then be further discussed with the management.

### Possible KPIs:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- The Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

The above dashboard provides trends and insights into various metrics and KPIs related to the Call Centre data. It also provides the option of applying various filters such as Satisfaction Rating, Agent Name, Week, Topic etc. <br> Major Highlights from the Dashboard: 
- 72% of the cases which were logged were resolved.
- the agents answered 81% of the calls.
- The average satisfaction rating was 3.4.
- There were equal # of cases for each topic.
  
## PowerBI Dashboard-2: Telecom Customer Retention Strategy
The Retention Manager at PhoneNow has contacted you as he/management wants insights into the customer demographics. We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management. Create a dashboard that visualizes the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights. Draft a concise email to the Retention Manager at PhoneNow explaining your findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes to retain customers who are at risk of switching to a different telecom provider.

The data provided has around 7043 customer records out of which 1869 have left within the last month. 
- One trend that seems a bit peculiar is that customers are opting out of paperless billings (A whooping 1400 customers). A survey asking the customers as to why they are opting for "Paper Billings", can help to improve/earn new customers.
- Looking at the customer demographics data, customers who do not have any dependents and those who are unmarried are most likely to leave. Around 1200 unmarried customers and 1500 customers without dependents have left. Listening to their demands/pain points can help to lower the churn rate.
- Priorities in having a 1 or 2-year contract with the customers, as customers with contracts less than these will tend to opt out of your telecom services (Around 1655 customers had signed month-to-month contracts).
- Fibre-optic customers also seem to be unhappy with the service, almost 1300 customers have left within the last month. An in-depth study as to why the service is not performing up to the mark is the need of the hour.
- One more area to focus your attention towards is your digital technology stack. The electronic check method seems to have been frequently failing, which may have frustrated the 1K users who used the Electronic check method. Also, try to figure out if there are any significant issues with other payment issues. Fixing them can help to a great extent.
- Finally, explaining the benefits of having device protection will help in retaining a significant chunk of the customers.
Working on the above points will help in retaining customers and lowering your churn rate for the next month.

# PowerBI-Dashboard-3: Diversity and Inclusion
The HR department at PhoneNow is highly into diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. Create visualizations to represent HR data. Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs. Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.

# Power-BI Dashboard-4: Online Retail Store
As a consultant, you need to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. Management wants to analyse, what are the major contributing factors to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data. Help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

## Task 1:
Questions a CEO can ask:
1) Which regions are generating the most/least revenue? - Based on the fundamental source of income for the business, i.e., revenue. Revenue analysis is important to the CEO as top-level executives are always focused on earnings and how to increase it.

2) What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?, Is there any seasonality in the sales? - Provide the CEO with insights on how the revenue is fluctuating each month. Such seasonal months would be necessary to identify as the CEO would be interested in devising a strategy that would gain the maximum benefit from the months that have greater demands.

3) Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified? - Identify what are the main drivers behind the total revenue, derive a strategy where the top customers can be targeted with more products that they can buy, and increase revenue. If the business is highly dependent on a few customers, the plan would be to increase the customer base and target more customers which would bring more revenue to the store.

Questions a CMO can ask:
1) What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders? Are they ordering the same products or different? - Come up with a strategy to target these customers with more offers and products that they would need. The analysis will also be done to see what they are buying the second time. Accordingly offers can be rolled out for these customers.

2) What is the frequency of their repeat orders? - Determining how long the customers are taking to re-order from the store. Create a strategy to get the recent customers to revisit the business and spend more. For the customers who have not made purchases again from the store, efforts can be made to remind them that it has been a while since they last purchased from the store.

3) What revenue is being generated from the customers who have ordered more than once? - Devise a marketing strategy to encourage customers who spend more money on repeat purchases to continue to do so.

## Task 2:
You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyse for the online retail store that would explain the data and insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that you are trying to present. Gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. They want to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company, identify opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. 

Common business scenarios and the best-suited visual:
1) A line chart is used to represent repeated measurements taken over regular time intervals/plotting continuous data like date and time. Time is always displayed on the horizontal axis and values on the vertical axis. The result is a simple, straightforward way to visualize changes in one value relative to another. The line chart would enable the CEO to see important changes in the data, like seasonality or cyclic behaviour, which will provide a better understanding of the revenue and help forecast better. 

2) A stacked bar chart would be used here as the chart allows users to compare subcomponent pieces across different categories. The height or length of the bars will represent the total revenue generated by each country. Each bar will be divided into the products sold, where the major portion will be allocated to the products that are generating more revenue. This will allow the CMO to view the total revenue data as well as the revenue for each individual product.

3) The box plot would show the distribution of data based on a five-number summary (“minimum”, first quartile, median, third quartile, and “maximum”). Boxplots are used to graphically demonstrate the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data. Boxplots are used to graphically demonstrate the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data. By using the boxplot, we can easily spot outliers and the distribution of the plot.

4) Column charts are used to display comparisons between different items, highlight differences, show trends and outliers, and reveal historical highs and lows. They are especially effective when you have data that can be split into multiple categories. In this case, the column chart would display the top 10 customers who are contributing the most to revenue. The first bar on the left would be the longest one and would display information for the customer who bought the most goods from the online store. The revenue contributed by each customer would gradually decline as the bars move to the right.

5) A horizontal bar is often the go-to option for categorical data because it’s easy to read than the vertical bar and can also accommodate large category names.

6) A map chart would allow the CEO to view the demand information in a single view. The map chart will have all the countries on a single map and the demand will be displayed by highlighting the area of each country. Dark highlights would mean that the countries have high demand for products whereas the countries that are highlighted light colour are the ones that have low demand. Geographical data is best visualised using map charts as they are very easy to view and the underlying values are also easy to analyse.

7) Pie charts are powerful for adding detail to other visualizations. Alone, a pie chart doesn’t give the viewer a way to quickly and accurately compare information. Since the viewer has to create context on their own, key points from your data are missed. Instead of making a pie chart the focus of your dashboard, try using it to drill down on other visualizations.

8) Density maps reveal patterns or relative concentrations that might otherwise be hidden helping you to identify locations with greater or fewer numbers of data points. Density maps are most effective when working with a data set containing many data points in a small geographic area.

9) Scatter plots are an effective way to investigate the relationship between different variables, showing if one variable is a good predictor of another, or if they tend to change independently. A scatter plot presents lots of distinct data points on a single chart. The chart can then be enhanced with analytics like cluster analysis or trend lines. Scatter plots can also be expanded to additional variables by adding color, shape, or size to each point as indicators. When a third variable represents time, points in a scatter plot can be connected with line segments, generating a connected scatter plot. 

10) Gantt charts display a project schedule or show changes in activity over time. A Gantt chart shows steps that need to be completed before others can begin, along with resource allocation.

11) Although bubbles aren’t technically their own type of visualization, using them as a technique adds detail to scatter plots or maps to show the relationship between three or more measures. Varying the size and color of circles creates visually compelling charts that present large volumes of data at once.

12) Treemaps relate different segments of your data to the whole. As the name of the chart suggests, each rectangle in a treemap is subdivided into smaller rectangles, or sub-branches, based on its proportion to the whole. They make efficient use of space to show percent total for each category.

13) Simple Text - If there are just a few numbers with some supporting text, directly showing the numbers might be the best way out instead of graphs.

14) Heatmap - Heatmap is simply an upgraded version of a table where we add colors to interpret the data or numbers better. <br> ![image](https://github.com/NinadPatil66/PwC-PowerBI-Virtual-Experience-Program/assets/149456265/f67118bc-eb9a-4cf8-af82-a82b47a99d6b)

15) Slope Graph - Slope graph is simply a special case of line graph which is ideal for comparing change in metrics over two different points or time periods. This is really good to intuitively show the rate of change (increase or decrease rate is indicated by the slope of lines) along with the absolute values.

16) Waterfall - A waterfall chart is another special case of a vertical bar that can be used to either pull subcomponents of a stacked bar to focus one at a time, or to show a starting point, increases and decreases, and the resulting ending point. <br> ![image](https://github.com/NinadPatil66/PwC-PowerBI-Virtual-Experience-Program/assets/149456265/677d1063-3d69-4fe3-af22-9f60ff742a0b)

17) Area Charts - Area graphs should be avoided whenever possible because human eyes are not so good at comparing values in two-dimensional space. But if you badly want to include multiple metrics, then the area graph might work out.
