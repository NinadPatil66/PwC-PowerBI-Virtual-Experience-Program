# Introduction:
The virtual experience program provided a risk-free way to experience work on the job at PwC. I worked through different real-life but fictitious business use cases where PowerBI was used to design convincing visualizations to identify patterns, risks and opportunities in data, and turn them into actionable insights. 

## Details:
•	Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.<br>
•	Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.<br>
•	Strong communication skills reflected in concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.<br>
•	Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

## PowerBI-Dashboard-1: Call Centre Trends
Respond to the client's request by providing a well-designed Power BI dashboard reflecting the requested KPIs. The client is PhoneNow, a telecom giant. Their call centre manager contacted you to provide some level of insight and transparency into the call centre data, for example, the total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. This will help her in getting an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. These insights will then be further discussed with the management.

### Possible KPIs:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- The Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

The above dashboard provides trends and insights into various metrics and KPIs related to the Call Centre data. It also provides the option of applying various filters such as Satisfaction Rating, Agent Name, Week, Topic etc. <br> Major Highlights from the Dashboard: 
- 72% of the cases which were logged were resolved.
- the agents answered 81% of the calls.
- The average satisfaction rating was 3.4.
- There were equal # of cases for each topic.
  
## PowerBI Dashboard-2: Telecom Customer Retention Strategy
The Retention Manager at PhoneNow has contacted you as he/management wants insights into the customer demographics. We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management. Create a dashboard that visualizes the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights. Draft a concise email to the Retention Manager at PhoneNow explaining your findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes to retain customers who are at risk of switching to a different telecom provider.

The data provided has around 7043 customer records out of which 1869 have left within the last month. 
- One trend that seems a bit peculiar is that customers are opting out of paperless billings (A whooping 1400 customers). A survey asking the customers as to why they are opting for "Paper Billings", can help to improve/earn new customers.
- Looking at the customer demographics data, customers who do not have any dependents and those who are unmarried are most likely to leave. Around 1200 unmarried customers and 1500 customers without dependents have left. Listening to their demands/pain points can help to lower the churn rate.
- Priorities in having a 1 or 2-year contract with the customers, as customers with contracts less than these will tend to opt out of your telecom services (Around 1655 customers had signed month-to-month contracts).
- Fibre-optic customers also seem to be unhappy with the service, almost 1300 customers have left within the last month. An in-depth study as to why the service is not performing up to the mark is the need of the hour.
- One more area to focus your attention towards is your digital technology stack. The electronic check method seems to have been frequently failing, which may have frustrated the 1K users who used the Electronic check method. Also, try to figure out if there are any significant issues with other payment issues. Fixing them can help to a great extent.
- Finally, explaining the benefits of having device protection will help in retaining a significant chunk of the customers.
Working on the above points will help in retaining customers and lowering your churn rate for the next month.  

# PowerBI-Dashboard-3: Diversity and Inclusion
The HR department at PhoneNow is highly into diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. Create visualizations to represent HR data. Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs. Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.
